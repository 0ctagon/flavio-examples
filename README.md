# flavio example notebooks

This repository contains [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks with usage examples of [flavio](https://flav-io.github.io/), a Python package for flavour physics phenomenology in the Standard Model and beyond.

The notebooks can be previewed directly in the Github web interface.

Feel free to submit your own examples!
